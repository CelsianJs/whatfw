# what-mcp

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) server for [What Framework](https://whatfw.com). Gives AI assistants access to What Framework documentation, API references, and code examples.

## Install

```bash
npm install what-mcp
```

## Usage

### With Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "what-framework": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["what-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Run directly

```bash
npx what-mcp
```

The server communicates over stdio using the MCP protocol.
