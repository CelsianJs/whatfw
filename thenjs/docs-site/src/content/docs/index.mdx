## Core

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Hook-Based Server" icon="setting">
    8 lifecycle hooks give you full control: onRequest, preParsing, preValidation, preHandler, preSerialization, onSend, onResponse, onError. Plugin encapsulation keeps middleware isolated.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Type-Safe RPC" icon="puzzle">
    Build procedures with input/output schema validation (Zod, TypeBox, Valibot). Compose nested routers. Call from the client with full TypeScript inference. Auto-generated OpenAPI specs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="File-Based Routing" icon="document">
    Pages in `src/pages/`, API routes in `src/api/`, RPC in `src/rpc/` — all auto-discovered at build time. Supports static, SSR, hybrid, and client rendering modes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Deploy Anywhere" icon="rocket">
    Adapters for Node.js and Vercel. Compatible with Bun (`Bun.serve({ fetch: app.fetch })`) and Deno (`Deno.serve(app.fetch)`). Web Standard APIs mean zero runtime lock-in.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Real-Time & Background

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="SSE & WebSockets" icon="star">
    Server-Sent Events with `createSSEStream()` and fan-out hubs. WebSocket abstractions with rooms, broadcasting, and registry-based routing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Task Queues" icon="list-format">
    Background job processing with retry/backoff, concurrency control, and delayed execution. Cron scheduler with human-readable schedules like `"every 5m"`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Caching & Sessions" icon="open-book">
    Response caching with `x-cache: HIT/MISS` headers. KV store abstraction with TTL, batch ops, and atomic counters. Cookie-based session management.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Middleware Ecosystem" icon="approve-check-circle">
    CORS, rate limiting, JWT auth, structured logging, and ETag — all built-in. Register with one line: `app.register(cors, { origin: '*' })`.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
